A profile pin can go to multiple duts. The dut id is associated with the
dest_pin_name. Code needs to handle multiple tags of the same kind if
we have two duts for example. Note that you can technically program multiple
duts with the same config pins. This only works because we are writing and
not reading, since it's a fanout. A dots file however writes and reads and
so the pins used must not be shared in the fanout but physically seperated
to different sets of dut_io profile pins per dut.

For bitstream you can select dut 0 and 1 if board is wired this way. Probably 
better to split out the config pins per dut when designing board. Of course,
you could program all n duts with one shot and then run the dots for each
dut seperately. Then you need to specify in flowfile dut_ids per bitstream
or dots, versus for all patterns in flow if each are split out.

one shot design:
    CCLK ---------- DUT 0
                |
                --- DUT 1

split out design:
    CCLK ---------- DUT 0
    CCLK ---------- DUT 1

Must select dut 0 since we read
    DIN (L9) ----- DUT 0
    DOUT (L10) --- DUT 0

Must select dut 1 since we read
    DIN (L9) ----- DUT 1
    DOUT (L10) --- DUT 1
