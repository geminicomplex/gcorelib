        GEMINI CORE LIBRARY
        Gcorelib v1.2.1


===============================================================================
OVERVIEW
===============================================================================

The Gemini Core Library or gcorelib provides a low-level application
programming interface for working with dots/stim/prgm files and interacting
with the Gemini gcore driver. 

Gcorelib is built as a dynamic library that can be linked against at runtime.
All the board specific APIs are located in the "board" directory and are used
by internal software, only when actually running on the Gemini Tester.

INSTALL
